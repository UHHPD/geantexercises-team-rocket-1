# Exercise 1

## a)

### a) 1 GeV
Dominantly ionization losses by knocking out electrons of Pb atoms.


### b) 10 GeV
Bremsstrahlung and some ionization.

### c) 100 GeV
Dominated by bremsstrahlung also leading to pair production.

### d) 0.3 GeV
Decays at around the midpoint of the block.

### e) 1000 GeV
Mostly Bremsstrahlung but also passes through lead quickly and barely interacts.

## b)
4.77 Mev cm^2 / g
