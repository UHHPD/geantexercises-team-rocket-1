# Exercise 1

## a)

### a) 1 GeV
Dominantly ionization losses by knocking out electrons of Pb atoms.


### b) 10 GeV
Bremsstrahlung and some ionization.

### c) 100 GeV
Dominated by bremsstrahlung also leading to pair production.

### d) 0.3 GeV
Decays at around the midpoint of the block.

### e) 1000 GeV
Mostly Bremsstrahlung but also passes through lead quickly and barely interacts.

## b)
### a) muon - 4.77 Mev cm^2 / g
### b) pion - 2.56 MeV cm^2/g

## c)
### a)  Fe - 1.11 MeV cm^2/g
### b)  Pb - 0.837 MeV cm^2/g

## e)
